# Exam Scheduler
This project is made as part of the Intelligent Systems course. It uses CSP algorithms to schedule exams based on input *json* files, while also aiming to find the best solution (minimizing the cost function)

    cost = onDutyNum + 1.2 * offSiteRoomNum
 ** onDutyNum - the number of people on duty
 ** offSiteRoomNum - the number of rooms that are not located on the faculty campus
